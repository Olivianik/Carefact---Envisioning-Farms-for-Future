### :sparkles:About CareFACT
Agriculture is very significant in India's economy and jobs. Farmers' most prevalent problem is that they are unable to make informed decisions on which crops are supported in their areas, as well as market and profit prices. As a result, they have lower productivity and profit margins. The goal of this study is to propose an attempt to estimate agricultural output and price using machine learning, which will aid in crop selection based on soil type and meteorological conditions.

Farmers do not have a single point of contact for all of their needs, including crop, market price, soil type, government programs, and the latest news. To make this easier for farmers, a portal based on machine learning is being developed.
 
### :sparkles:About the Project 
Several studies were undertaken recently in India, including the one on DFI, have brought out the problems afflicting the agriculture sector. 

The recommendations of these studies include, inter alia, ensuring timely availability of inputs, an increased focus on measures to enhance the productivity - especially of small and marginal farms, adoption of modern agricultural practices, optimal use of inputs, choice of the right crops through macro and micro-level planning. CareFACT comes from the Hindi terms "Fasal" and "Kisaan," which mean "crops" and "farmers," respectively. As the name says, we work as a farmer's companion. Farmers play a critical role in both meeting our basic food needs and altering the agricultural environment. Farmers manage agricultural practices to maintain the long-term survival of the entire flora and fauna. 

Agriculture presently occupies one-third of the world's land surface. For a big majority of the world's population, it is the most essential activity since it produces food for people all over the world.

> The features include:
> 1. **Gain Insights** - Centralized source of truth for farmers to gain insights into their land. Our software allows farmers to optimally plan farm layouts and maximize efficiency and revenue.
> 2. **Plan Out Field** - The user is able to indicate plots of land where they want to plant and indicate the crop they want to plant there. Based on real-time data about air quality, soil and weather conditions,
> 3. **Real Time Analysis with Environment Impact** - CareFACT will determine how suitable a particular area is for planting a particular crop, and provide a general estimation on the expected value of a plot.
> 4. **Environment Degradation** - CareFACT would determine a CareFACT Score that would determine the degradation the particular farm field is creating because of the crops and irrigation sources
> 5. **AI Based Help** - CareFACT is AI based solution which makes it the best platform to suggest farmers crops and also given them suggestions about not-so-good combinations and crop rotation techniques
> 6. **Crop Yield and Estimation** - CareFACT will help ypu detrermine the growth of your formed field in the platform - how well it performs in all the 4 seasons.  This would help the farmers know about the estimated cost anf fundings to be taken beforehand.
